"""Port-contract guards for the Rust-only MPS backend.

These lock in the invariants that the port of Niklas's features
(``docs/NIKLAS_FEATURE_PORT_PLAN.md``) must never break:

1. the deleted Python scheduler modules stay gone,
2. ``DirectSampling.__call__`` exposes no ``progress`` hook (there is no
   per-node Python callback path anymore), and
3. a single ``DirectSampling`` call runs exactly one complete Rust-engine
   pass (no hidden Python scheduler loop, no extra passes).

They are deliberately cheap and import-light so they act as a fast tripwire
if a future feature accidentally reintroduces a Python numerical path.
