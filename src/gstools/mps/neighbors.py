def _precompute_offsets(shape, max_offset=None):
    """Neighbour offsets from the origin, sorted by Euclidean distance.

    Among equidistant offsets the order is a **canonical lexicographic**
    tie-break (by squared distance, then by each coordinate). This is
    platform- and NumPy-version-independent — unlike the default ``argsort``
    (unstable quicksort), whose tie order is implementation-defined — so that
    ``n_neighbors`` cutting mid-shell yields the same neighbour subset, and the
    simulation is reproducible across machines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple
        Simulation grid shape.
    max_offset : int, optional
        Maximum offset in any dimension (a radius cap). ``None`` → unlimited,
        i.e. each axis spans the full grid extent.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray, shape (N, dim)

    Notes
    -----
    The envelope is built **per axis**, capped at ``shape[d] - 1`` on axis ``d``.
    An offset larger than ``shape[d] - 1`` can never land inside
    the grid from any node, so excluding it never changes which neighbours the
    engine finds, but it keeps a long thin grid such as ``(1000, 2, 2)`` from
    attempting the ``max(shape)``-wide cube that would allocate hundreds of GB.

    ``grid_shape + (n_comp,)`` (stationary specs are zero-stride broadcast
    views), so indexing is uniform and no ndim heuristics are needed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dim : int
        Spatial dimensionality of the simulation grid.
    rotation_map : numpy.ndarray or None
        Canonical rotation map, shape ``grid_shape + (no_of_angles(dim),)``.
        ``None`` → no rotation.
    scale_map : numpy.ndarray or None
        Canonical scale map, shape ``grid_shape + (dim,)``. ``None`` → no
